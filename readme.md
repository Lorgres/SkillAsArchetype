# Skill feats as Free Archetype feats

The Free Archetype variant rule limits the use of the free feat slots to Class feats.
This is a simple module which allows feat slots created by the Free Archetype rule to accept Skill feats such as 'Reverse Engineer', a feat from the Scrounger dedication.

The Module works by overwriting the allowed Feats in the Archetype section of a character sheet to include Skill feats.
This is done automatically any time a player character is updated.

While this allows placing Skill feats in the Archetype slots of a character sheet it does not change the default filter options when searching for archetype feats.
